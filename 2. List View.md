# Hotel List API Endpoint

We're gonna build an API Endpoint that returns as response a list of all Pokemon objects from our database as JSON.

Response should look like this:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "PikaPika",
        "description": "A funny-looking zappy rat.",
        "id": 1
    },
    {
        "name": "Snorlax",
        "description": "A really really 'laxed dude.",
        "id": 2
    },
    {
        "name": "Dragonite",
        "description": "A flying jolly.",
        "id": 3
    },
    ...
]
```

# Install Django REST framework

```bash
$ pip install djangorestframework
```

`settings.py`

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework',
]
```

# Pokemon List View

## Block 00 (Views)

`views.py`

```python
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView

from .models import Pokemon
from .serializers import PokemonSerializer


class PokemonList(ListAPIView):
	queryset = Pokemon.objects.all()
	serializer_class = PokemonSerializer
```

## Block 01 (Serializer)

Create `serializers.py`.

```python
from rest_framework import serializers

from .models import Pokemon


class PokemonSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
	class Meta:
		model = Pokemon
		fields = ['name', 'description', 'id']
```

## Block 02 (URLs)

`urls.py`

```python
[...]
from pokeapp import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('pokemon/', views.PokemonList.as_view(), name="pokemon-list"),
]
```

## Test with Postman

## What is a Serializer?

It's a component of the backend that converts our data to JSON format.

It's responsible for how the response data is structured.
